    * Tips to defining your APIs:
        * Identify each core resource in the business problem - client, therapist, session, journal, journal entry, mapping, etc.
        * You must define CRUDL Operations for each Core Resources.
            * When you have a core resource like “client,” start by defining its core CRUDL methods (Create, Read, Update, Delete, List) -
            * Create (POST /clients)
            * Read (GET /clients/{clientId})
            * Update (PUT /clients/{clientId})
            * Delete (DELETE /clients/{clientId})
            * List (GET /clients)
            * These fundamental operations form the backbone of your API for that resource. After establishing these, you can add any specialized endpoints (like search) that extend the resource’s functionality.
        * Organize API Paths by Root Objects
            * When defining OpenAPI paths, group them under their “root” objects in a logical order. 
            * For example, start with /clients, then follow with any subpaths like /clients/{clientId}, /clients/{clientId}/therapist, etc. Once you finish all the /clients-related paths, move on to the next root object—such as /therapists—and list all those paths. This way, your specification stays organized, easy to read, and follows a clear hierarchy for each root object before switching to a new one.
        * Align API Methods With Resource Scope
            * When defining paths, keep the methods relevant to the resource they represent. 
            * For example, in /clients/{clientId}, include GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE operations specifically for managing client data (e.g., fetching client details or updating client information). 
            * Don’t mix unrelated operations (like therapist-client associations) in this path. This keeps each route focused on a single resource and makes your API more intuitive.
        * Use Components Section
            * Use the OpenAPI Components section for schemas, requestBodies and responses for better code readability and reusability.
     * More resources. Refer only if you want to really dig deep.
        * [Getting Started with Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) 
        * [Swagger OpenAPI Specifications. Very elaborate documentation. Only refer when needed.](https://swagger.io/specification/)
        * [Swagger Tools](https://swagger.io/tools/)


* Step 2: **Model**: Database for the project needs to be Dynamo DB. Design the Dynamo DB schema for the assignment. Get it reviewed with Prateek (contact details given below). Helpful guides:
   * [Understanding DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)

   * **For submitting a review:**
       * Creata a github account if you haven't already.
       * Create a NEW git repository in your OWN account with 2 branches, "main" and "assignment".
       * Push all your changes to the "assignment" branch and then create a pull request ([relevant doc](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)) from the "assignment" branch to the main branch.

       * Share the link to this PR link with Prateek (contact details given below)
   * **Tips for submitting a good review:**
       * It can be a txt file.
       * Define each object, its table.
       * For each DDB table, List each attribute and its data type. Which attribute is the hash partition key and range key? 
       * For each DDB table, what are additional GSI and LSI, what are the hash partition key and range key? 
       * For each of the APIs defined in Step 1, how are you constructing the query and which LSI/GSI are you using? 
* Step 3: **Implementation**: Once the API design and the database design is finalized and reviewed, you will start with the implementation. The Java APIs need to be deployable as a AWS API Gateway + Lambda solution as a AWS CDK application. You should be testing your APIs through Postman. Make a [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/collection/) containing all your API calls. All functionality should be executable over these APIs. Important Points:
    * Remember that we are looking ONLY for properly functioning backend APIs which can be demo-ed using Postman. We DO NOT expect you to make the frontend for the same.
    * If you don't know about AWS, backend API, serverless paradigm of computing, you can learn it here:
        * You can learn about basics of AWS and how to create one account here by going through first 17 mins of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubCNZRNjhyo).
        * You can learn about AWS IAM basics from the first 19m 15s of this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjVFf83dcE8).
        * Udemy Course - [Serverless using AWS Lambda for Java Developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-programming-using-aws-lambda-for-java-developers/).

    * (Optional) Dependency injection through Dagger/Guice
* Document **list of assumptions** made, which are not covered in the stories but have been used in building the app.


### Assessment Criteria
* Maintainability and organisation of code.
* Balancing between speed and quality of code - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges. If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them in comments. We do value calculated & well reasoned assumptions.
* Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product. Optional elements above provide you a way to get more brownie points assuring success.
* No submissions to be made with compressed/binary files - all source code should be version controlled and visible in plain text in github. This is essential to our idealogy of public submission by interview candidates, not creating a competitive advantage for EffDog employees or organization.
* How much the candidate stays in touch with us during the process of the project. What is the quality of clarifying questions they asked. How clear is their thought process. 
* Follow [best practices](https://github.community/t/best-practices-for-pull-requests/10195) for pull requests.
* Ability to learn and use version control via Git
