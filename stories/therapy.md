## Journalling for therapy

The pandemic, COVID-19, requires people to practice social distancing. Many are quarantined at home or at temporary facilities. In the light of the new social dynamics, people experience feelings of isolation which potentially have an impact on mental health. Therapy, once taboo, is starting to be acceptable in society. However, there are a few problems therapists and clients may face while engaging for therapy during this period of isolation –


1. Clients may face several emotions between therapy sessions. These crucial data points are inaccessible, and available only from memory recall.
2. Clients cannot seamlessly switch between therapists, or engage with more than one.
3. Therapists maintain notes and mind maps based on their interactions with clients. With growing clientele, managing these becomes challenging.

As a simple solution for the clients and the therapist, we need an app:
* For clients to maintain their **emotions journal**
* For therapists 
    * To view journals (authorised by clients) 
    * For making their own notes

The app must cover these stories –

*   A Client should be able to …
    *   Create a Client account and login using their email and password
    *   Search and map a Therapist to their account.
    *   View list of therapists who have access to emotions journal along with these actions –
        *   Remove a therapist mapped to account
        *   Remove a therapist’s access to the journal, but not mapping to account
        *   Send a message to a therapist and view the history of exchanges.
    *   Approve or reject a therapist’s request for access to Client emotions journal.
    *   Add record of an emotion felt. This should include the time of emotion, feeling and intensity (For vocabulary of emotions/feelings with intensity, refer to [this link](https://tomdrummond.com/app/uploads/2019/11/Emotion-Feelings.pdf))
    *   Request for an appointment in an available session.
    *   Select therapists from a list of available therapists on the platform.
    *   Run keyword search across Therapists’ notes and emotions journals.
*   A Therapist should be able to …
    *   Create a Therapist account and login using their email and password
    *   Create a new sessions (to which any client can apply). Each session with –
        *   Private notes, visible only to the therapist
        *   Shared notes with the client. For any assignments.
    *   View list of clients along with actions like –
        *   Request a new client to be mapped for therapy. This allows for associating session notes to client. By default, journal access is off. 
        *   Request a new client for journal access. 
        *   Send a message to a client and view the history of exchanges.
        *   Remove a client
    *   View client journals
    *   Modify details of each session
    *   Run keyword search across customers, notes and emotions journals.
